# Sanford Export Analysis - Tech Test

**Methodology**

1. Merge three-year data into PowerBI
2. Build a fact table, add a date column with default date of 01 July with corresponding financial year
3. Build dimension tables on Countries, Species, Product
4. Build a Dates table 
5. Build a star schema to relate the fact and dimension tables
6. Build measures
	-	Value 
	-	Volume 
	-	Previous Year Value 
	-	Previous Year Volume 
	-	Average Value / Volume
	-	Year-On-Year growth on : Value, Volume and Average Price Value/Volume 
7.	Built a table and a line chart for visualisations / reports
8.	Built pages on PowerBI

>**Right Market: Which countries offer best growth/pricing?**

- From the Right Countries page based on the 2025 FY TOP 15 countries by value, there are a couple of countries with over one million dollars in total value showing growth on both volume and value over the previous FY.
Countries such as Canada, Hong Kong, Korea, Thailand, Germany, Japan, Netherlands fall into this category. 
Vietnam and Malaysia also fall into this category despite their export value being under one million dollars.
Countries such as Netherlands and Vietnam have up to four-digit growth on value and volume after significant average price volume drop. 


>**Right Product: Which species/products are most profitable?**
- From the Right Products page, the stacked bar chart shows that Frozen Half Shell Mussels has the highest export value and volume, followed by Chilled Whole Salmon.
In FY2025, Mussel Oilâ€™s value and volume are declining in the US even after a drop in the average price. While in Japan it has increased in value and volume, even though the average price has increased by 2.62%.

>**Right Price: What's the optimal pricing strategy by market?**
- Referring to Pricing Strategy by Market page, filtered by FY 2025 Top 15 countries by value:
For countries such as Japan, Canada, Germany and Hong Kong, value and volume have increased despite an increase in average value/volume price. This means if Sanford puts a product price up, these countries are still a willing buyer. 
For example, Mussel Oil sales are declining in the US even after a drop in the average price. While in Japan keeps figures are growing despite average price increase by 2.62%. Mussel oil was the top selling product in Japan FY 2025 and increased steadily since FY2023.
For countries with positive growth in value and volume such as Thailand, Korea and France, product prices should be increased cautiously to avoid future drops in sales.
For countries with negative growth in value and volume, need to review high value products with declining sales. Presumably by planning a strategy of selling at discounted bulk rates  that would attract higher volumes, which in turn would increase sales.
